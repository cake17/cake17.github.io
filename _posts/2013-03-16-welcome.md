This is a tech blog about my experiences with CakePHP and the world around PHP (Composer, Git, ...). I have a Mac so the installs will refer to OS X Yosemite.

I'll write my messages in two languages, depending on the subject i'm dealing with. Sometimes in french, as it's my first language and it will be when I want to target this population, but most of the time it will be in english to target more people.

You can go to [Cake-Websites](http://www.cake-websites.com) for more information about my pricing and projects.
