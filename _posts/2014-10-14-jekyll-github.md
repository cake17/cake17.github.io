# Jekyll

Small website with Static Pages
You can create a full blog with pre-formated designs.
Jekyll is used in Github to create personal pages for projects or for develpers.

## Install

Run `gem install jekyll`

## Local

Run `jekyll serve --watch` in the website repo to launch a local server and to be able to modify files and see the changes directly.
