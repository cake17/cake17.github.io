## Jekyll

Small website with Static Pages
You can create a full blog with pre-formated designs.
Jekyll is used in Github to create personal pages for projects or for develpers.

### Install

Run `sudo gem install jekyll`

### Local

Open a terminal, go to the website repo with `cd` and type `jekyll serve -w`.
This launch a local server and now you can modify files and see the changes directly in your browser at the default address `http://0.0.0.0:4000`.

### Search with json

I got the idea from [this website](http://mathayward.com/jekyll-search)
