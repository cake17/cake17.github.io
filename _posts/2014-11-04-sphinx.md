Sphinx is a great tool to generate documentation, but it can be hard to install and to use. With these steps, it's gonna be a piece of cake. Don't hesitate to go to the [official website](http://sphinx-doc.org)

## Installation

- brew install python
- brew install sphinx
- pip install sphinxcontrib-phpdomain

## Usage

### Create a documentation for a project

Launch `sphinx-quickstart` in your terminal and follow instructions to create an empty project. Then sphinx documentations will let you create your docs by writing reStructuredText files.

### Generate the documentation

You can generate the docs in various formats. the MakeFile allows you to build the docs in the following formats::

- HTML
- LaTeX
- ePub
- Textinfo
- manual pages
- plain text
- pdf (needs to install complete latex on your computer)

For instance to create the doc in html, just run `make html`.

### Theme

Create a folder `_themes` and a .gitignore file with _themes in it. Go in themes and do `git clone git@github.com:snide/sphinx_rtd_theme.git` [ReadTheDocs Theme](https://github.com/snide/sphinx_rtd_theme)
