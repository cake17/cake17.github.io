This is a tech blog about my experiences with CakePHP and the world around PHP (Composer, Git, ...). I have a Mac so the installs will refer to OS X Yosemite.

This is mainly small reminders for me. I plan to add a comment section on articles. If you have suggestions, feel free to send me comments on github.

I'll write my messages in two languages, depending on the subject i'm dealing with. Sometimes in french, as it's my native language and it will be when I want to target this population, but most of the time it will be in english to be able to talk to more people.

You can go to [Cake-Websites](http://www.cake-websites.com) for more information about my pricing and projects.
