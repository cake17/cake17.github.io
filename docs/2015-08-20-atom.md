## Commands

Get list of commands : `Cmd + Shift + P`

Launch Atom from command line:

```bash
# will launch a window of the path where you are
atom .
# will launch a window of the path given
atom path/to/folder
```

Search files:

```atom
# Search a file
Cmd + t
# Search a file in the one open
Cmd + b
# Search a modified file in git
Cmd + Shift + b
```

Replace in a file : `Cmd + f` (in the entire project `Cmd + Shift + f`)


One I like the most : `shift-cmd-L` then you select multilines and can delete vertically caracters.
